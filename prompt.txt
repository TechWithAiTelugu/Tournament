Create a complete working tournament app using only two HTML files:

1. index.html â†’ For users to:
   - View all tournaments from Firebase Realtime Database.
   - Join a selected tournament by entering their name and team.
   - Display a list of participants after joining.

2. admin.html â†’ For admin to:
   - Add a new tournament (Tournament Name, Date, Description).
   - View all added tournaments.
   - View participants under each tournament.
   - Optionally           Database** for storing tournament data and participants.
- Use **Firebase JavaScript SDK** (CDN version).
- Include **all JavaScript and CSS inline** inside the HTML (no external files).
- Use simple and clean UI with modern design (card-style or form layout).
- Both pages must work fully and independently using Firebase.
- No frameworks like React, Angular â€“ just pure HTML, CSS, JS (with Firebase).

ðŸŽ¯ Output:
Give me:
- Fully working `index.html` file
- Fully working `admin.html` file

Each file should be ready to run with just Firebase configuration added.
